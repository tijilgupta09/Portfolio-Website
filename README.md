# 🚀 Tijil Gupta | Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project is a modern, responsive, and high-performance web application designed to showcase my skills as a Full-Stack Developer and my journey as an engineering student at **Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This portfolio is built using modern web technologies to ensure a smooth user experience and clean code architecture:

* **Frontend Library**: React (with Vite for fast builds).
* **Styling**: Pure CSS3 featuring:
    * Glassmorphism effects (Backdrop blur).
    * Dynamic linear gradients.
    * Complex CSS Animations (Fade-in-up effects).
* **Icons**: React Icons (Fa, Di, Si, Io sets).
* **Navigation**: Smooth scrolling implemented using React `useRef` hooks for precise DOM manipulation.

* **Smooth Navigation**: A fixed, glassmorphism-styled navbar that allows seamless navigation between "Home," "About," and "Projects".
* **Mobile-First Design**: Includes a dedicated mobile overlay menu that triggers for better accessibility on smaller screens.
* **Skills Grid**: A curated display of technical expertise including C++, Python, ReactJS, JavaScript, and MySQL, featuring interactive hover states.
